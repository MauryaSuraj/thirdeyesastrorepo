For example, if the marriage is 13 degrees and at the destination the teacher is 18 degrees, the effect of the guru will be 4.5 degrees at any point of view and at the same time, therefore, if the teacher grade is greater than the fraction of the marriage, the effect will not be in the ninth house and if the difference is less than 4.5, the effect will be affected. Therefore, when the difference is greater, the effect of the guru is not at any cost. Now, if the sun is at 10 degrees in the third house, then its effect will be both in the third and in the ninth, only in the fraction of the teacher, due to the difference of 8 (the sun will exceed more than forty-one) , the sun will be considered visually on the sun as long as the guru is not on the sun. In the same way, other planets will be affected.
